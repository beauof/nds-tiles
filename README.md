NDS Tiles Toolset
=================
A simple java implementation of the NDS Tiling Scheme along with some utility classes and functions.
Short feature list:

- Access NDS Tile properties and bounding boxes
- Convert between WGS84 and NDS coordinate formats
- Get Morton codes for NDS Coordinates
- GeoJSON output of all classes

Usage
=====

Compiling
---------
This is a simple maven project. You can build the current jar with
	
	$ mvn package

Development
-----------
I used the Lombok java agent for easy code generation of class' default methods etc.
See https://projectlombok.org/ for setup instructions if you want to include the source code in your projects with e.g. Eclipse.
